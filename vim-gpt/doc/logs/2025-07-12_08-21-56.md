**Filetype**: `perl`

## Prompt

```
'Complete the following perl code:

sub oth '
```

## Response

```
Your question seems to be incomplete, as you did not specify what the subroutine "oth" is supposed to do. However, here is an example of a simple Perl subroutine:

```perl
sub oth {
    my ($arg1, $arg2) = @_;
    # perform some operations
    my $result = $arg1 + $arg2;
    return $result;
}
```

In this example, the subroutine "oth" accepts two arguments, adds them together, and returns the result. You can call this subroutine with two numbers like this:

```perl
my $sum = oth(3, 4);
print $sum;  # outputs: 7
```

Please provide more details if you want a specific implementation.
